# SIMPUS
SIMPUS is a web-based Library Management Information System built with Go (Golang) using a modern server-side approach. It provides book and member management, borrowing &amp; returns, late notifications, transaction history, and periodical reports. Authentication uses JWT, with Templ for templating and HTMX for dynamic interactions without a SPA.
